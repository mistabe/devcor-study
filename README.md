4.6 Describe an effective logging strategy for an application

4.7 Explain data privacy concerns related to storage and transmission of data

4.8 Identify the secret storage approach relevant to a given scenario

4.11 Describe how end-to-end encryption principles apply to APIs

5.1 Explain considerations of model-driven telemetry (including data consumption and data storage)

5.4 Identify a configuration management solution to achieve technical and business requirements

5.5 Describe how to host an application on a network device (including Catalyst 9000 and Cisco IOx-enabled devices)

4.2 Integrate an application into a prebuilt CD environment leveraging Docker and Kubernetes

4.4 Utilize Docker to containerize an application

4.9 Configure application specific SSL certificates

4.10 Implement mitigation strategies for OWASP threats (such as XSS, CSRF, and SQL injection)

5.2 Utilize RESTCONF to configure a network device including interfaces, static routes, and VLANs (IOS XE only)

5.3 Construct a workflow to configure network parameters with:

    5.3.a Ansible playbook
    5.3.b Puppet manifest

## Approach

I utilise the Pomodoro Technique for all learning. It's critical to manage your energy and not "piss in the wind" as they say with your attention and mental energy.

Certainly reccommend learning Python before starting the DEV*** certification paths. It's certainly helped me to have gone through the PCEP and PCAP certification process before.
